defmodule PhoenixKitCRM.PubSub do
  @moduledoc """
  Real-time updates for CRM interactions, backed by `PhoenixKit.PubSub.Manager`.

  An interaction appears in the feed of every contact it involves — the subject
  contact (`interactions.contact_uuid`) and any resolved **party** contacts — so
  a change fans out to each of their per-contact topics. A contact's
  Interactions tab subscribes to its own topic; any add/edit/delete to an
  interaction touching that contact pushes a live refresh.

  Messages are `{:crm, event, payload}` tuples where `event` is one of
  `:interaction_created | :interaction_updated | :interaction_deleted` and
  `payload` is `%{interaction_uuid: uuid}`.

  Topics are global (no tenant partitioning) — but the per-contact topic is keyed
  by uuid, so you can't subscribe without already knowing the contact, which
  bounds the fan-out. (Mirrors `phoenix_kit_projects` — tenant scoping is a
  framework-wide gap, not a CRM one.)
