defmodule PhoenixKitCRM.Lists.Import do
  @moduledoc """
  Pure-ish CSV/plaintext import engine for CRM contact lists (Stage 3 of the
  restructuring plan — the user's stated priority: account list import).
  Parses rows, applies the restructuring spec's Locked decisions, and writes
  only through `PhoenixKitCRM.Lists` — it never duplicates that context's
  insert/counter/broadcast logic.

  ## Locked decisions this engine enforces

    * Import always creates a NEW contact — never a merge, never "add to
      existing contact by matching email". Matching duplicates across
      contacts is a separate, later, human-reviewed comparison screen
      (Stage C4c), not something this engine decides on its own.
    * Per-row atomicity: contact INSERT + membership INSERT happen in ONE
      transaction (`Lists.add_new_contact_to_list/3`) — a uniqueness
      violation rolls both back, so a failed/duplicate row never leaves an
      orphan contact behind.
    * Idempotent re-import: importing the identical file twice creates zero
      new contacts on the second pass — every row lands in `skipped`
      instead of `created`/`added` (`:already_in_list` if the existing
      membership is still active, `:unsubscribed` if a prior membership was
      removed but still holds the email slot per the DB's partial unique
      index — see `ListMember`'s moduledoc).

  ## Row pipeline

  Each row goes through, in order: normalize (trim + downcase, matching the
  `email` column's citext case-insensitivity) → in-file dedup prefilter
  (`:duplicate_in_file` — a second row with the same email, e.g. a shared
  mailbox listed under two names, never reaches the DB) → email format
  check (`:invalid_email`) → the one write transaction, classifying any
  `idx_crm_list_members_list_email` violation by looking up the existing
  holder's status.

  `name` is CSV-optional per the spec; a blank name falls back to the email
  itself (mirrors `Contact.display_name/1`'s own fallback) so the contact
  changeset's `validate_required([:name])` never rejects an otherwise-valid
  row. `locale`, if present but not in a recognized format, is silently
  dropped rather than rejecting the row over a cosmetic field. `company`
  has no dedicated contact field yet (linking to `PhoenixKitCRM.Companies`
  is out of scope here) — it's stashed in `contact.metadata["import_company"]`
  so the comparison screen (C4c) can still surface it later instead of the
  data being silently discarded.

  ## XLSX

  Deliberately not supported yet. `xlsxir` (the library the plan asked to
  evaluate) is unmaintained since 2019 — not something to add as a new
  dependency. `xlsx_reader` is an actively-maintained alternative but wasn't
  evaluated in depth (its own dependency footprint, streaming behavior, etc.
  is a separate task). CSV/TXT cover the stated priority (account import);
  XLSX is deferred to a follow-up rather than shipped on an abandoned lib.

  Classifies every row exactly like `import_csv/3`/`import_text/3` would,

  collide on `idx_crm_list_members_list_email` is detected via ONE batched
  `Lists.members_by_email/2` lookup (all distinct emails in the file, one
  query) instead of attempting (and rolling back) an insert per row. A
  naive per-row `Lists.get_member_by_email/2` call here would mean tens of
  thousands of sequential round trips for a file near the upload size
  limit, blocking the LiveView process on a single, unyielding preview
  event — this is a dry-run specifically so it has to stay cheap.

  Returns the same `%ImportReport{}` shape — `created`/`added` mean "would
  be created/added" — with the full file's counts, so the caller decides
  how many of `rows` to actually render (e.g. the first 20 for a preview).

  Not a 100% guarantee of the real run's outcome: a row that fails
  `Contacts.create_contact/1`'s validation for a reason unrelated to email
  uniqueness (e.g. an oversized name) only surfaces at the real
  `import_csv/3`/`import_text/3` call, since this never attempts the
  insert.
