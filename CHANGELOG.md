## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-19

Stage 3 of the restructuring plan (PR #13): CRM contact lists, a CSV/text
account importer, per-list locale with bulk-apply, contact opt-out/consent,
and a duplicate-email/list-overlap comparison screen. Requires
`phoenix_kit >= 1.7.203` (the core migration shipping
`phoenix_kit_crm_lists`/`phoenix_kit_crm_list_members` and the CRM broadcast
source columns on newsletters).

### Added

- **`PhoenixKitCRM.Lists`** — named, sluggable contact lists
  (`active`/`archived`), soft-deleted memberships (`subscribed` / `pending` /
  `removed`, never hard-deleted), a maintained `subscriber_count` cache, and
  contact-level opt-out/consent (`opted_out_at` + an append-only `consent`
  log) that applies across every list a contact belongs to. Every
  list/membership mutation broadcasts over `crm:lists` for live subscriber
  counters and admin-UI refresh.
- **`PhoenixKitCRM.Lists.Import`** — CSV (header row, `email`/`name`/
  `company`/`locale` columns) and plaintext (one email per line) import,
  with a no-write dry-run preview and a chunked real run (200 rows/message)
  so a large file doesn't block the LiveView process. Classifies every row
  (`imported` / `already_in_list` / `unsubscribed` / `duplicate_in_file` /
  `no_email` / `invalid_email`); idempotent re-import creates zero duplicate
  contacts.
- **Per-list locale + bulk-apply**: a list can carry a content-language tag,
  bulk-applied to its subscribed members' contacts in `:missing_only`
  (default) or `:all` (overwrite) mode, with a preview of how many contacts
  each mode would touch before confirming.
- **Comparison screen** (`/admin/crm/comparison`): directory-wide duplicate
  emails (expandable to the actual contacts) and cross-list overlap (2+
  lists → contacts subscribed to all of them). Read-only — no merge/remove
  actions.
- Search + pagination on the existing Contacts, Companies, and
  `PartyRoles.list_{companies,contacts}_with_role` listings (previously
  unpaginated, full-table).
- `nimble_csv` dependency for CSV parsing (pure Elixir, already resolved
  transitively via `phoenix_kit`).

### Fixed

- `ComparisonLive`, `ListMembersLive`, and `ListImportLive` queried the
  database directly in `mount/3`, which Phoenix invokes twice per page visit
  (disconnected HTTP render + connected LiveSocket mount) — doubling a
  full-table duplicate-email aggregate scan on every comparison-page visit
  and doubling a primary-key list lookup on the two per-list pages. Moved
  into `handle_params/3`, matching the pattern this PR's own `ListFormLive`/
  `ListsLive` (and the pre-existing `ContactShowLive`) already used
  correctly.
- `phoenix_kit` dependency floor was `>= 1.7.197`, below **1.7.203** — the
  version that actually first shipped core migration V152
  (`phoenix_kit_crm_lists`/`phoenix_kit_crm_list_members`). Installing this
  package at its own previously-stated floor would compile and boot, then
  crash the first time any Lists/Comparison page loaded
  (`relation "phoenix_kit_crm_lists" does not exist`). Floor corrected to
  `>= 1.7.203`.

### Notes

- Postgres was not available in this release's build environment;
  `:integration` (DB/LiveView) tests auto-excluded per this repo's
  documented stance — only unit tests ran (90 passed, 0 failures). The full
  `ComparisonLiveTest`/`ListMembersLiveTest`/`ListImportLiveTest` suites
  (which exercise the `mount/3` → `handle_params/3` fix above end-to-end)
  are expected to run against a real core checkout before this reaches
  production installs.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-17

First release of the CRM v2 party-roles work (PRs #9-#12): companies and
contacts can now hold commercial `supplier`/`client`/`partner` roles, schemas
carry `PhoenixKit.SchemaPrefix` for named-schema (`--prefix`) installs, and a
one-time backfill task migrates catalogue suppliers into CRM. Requires
`phoenix_kit >= 1.7.197` (the core migration shipping
`phoenix_kit_crm_party_roles` and `phoenix_kit_cat_suppliers.crm_company_uuid`).

### Added

- **`PhoenixKitCRM.PartyRoles`** — grant/revoke `supplier`, `client`, `partner`
  roles on a company or contact (soft-ref polymorphic rows, idempotent grant,
  revoke keeps history instead of deleting). Roles checkboxes on both
  company/contact forms; role badges + filter tabs on both list pages.
  Mutations log `crm.party_role_granted` / `crm.party_role_revoked` with the
  acting user's `actor_uuid`.
- **`mix phoenix_kit_crm.import_suppliers_from_catalogue`** — one-time,
  dry-run-by-default backfill: matches each `phoenix_kit_cat_suppliers` row to
  an existing CRM company by email then normalized website, creates a company
  otherwise, grants the `supplier` role, and stamps `crm_company_uuid` back
  onto the catalogue row. Idempotent; guarded against a missing catalogue
  table or an out-of-date core (`crm_company_uuid` column absent).
- `use PhoenixKit.SchemaPrefix` on every table-backed schema (`RoleSetting`,
  `Company`, `CompanyMembership`, `Contact`, `Interaction`, `InteractionParty`,
  `UserRoleViewConfig`, `PartyRole`) — a no-op unless the host app configures
  `:phoenix_kit, :prefix`. A conformance test enforces it repo-wide.
- `dev_docs/design/crm_v2_parties_suppliers_clients.md` — the design spec this
  release implements Phases 1 and 3 of (Phase 2's catalogue-side resolver and
  Phase 4's client/warehouse seam are future work).

### Changed

- Involved-parties search (`interactions_component.ex`) switched from a
  hand-rolled `PartyPicker` JS hook to core's `<.search_picker>` component;
  the old hook's static asset was deleted.
- `phoenix_kit` dependency floor raised `~> 1.7 and >= 1.7.189` →
  `>= 1.7.197`.

### Fixed

- Party-role grant/revoke activity log entries now record the acting user's
  `actor_uuid` instead of always logging `nil`.
- `ContactFormLive`'s partial-role-failure path re-reads persisted role state
  from the DB before re-rendering (was showing stale checkbox state;
  `CompanyFormLive` already did this correctly).
- Supplier-import email matching lowercases both sides of the comparison (works
  whether the core migration has promoted the column to `citext` or not),
  excludes trashed companies, and resolves duplicate emails to the oldest
  match instead of raising; website matching lowercases before stripping the
  scheme/`www.` prefix so uppercase stored URLs normalize the same as the
  Elixir-side helper.
- Supplier-import per-row processing: a grant/stamp/match failure on one row
  records an `:error` row and the run continues instead of aborting — the
  report always prints. The report's `errors:` total previously only counted
  failed company-creation (`:error_creating`), silently dropping these
  rescued-exception rows from the summary; it now counts both.
- `mix dialyzer` — added `:mix` to `plt_add_apps` (`mix.exs`). The supplier
  backfill task is this repo's first file under `lib/mix/tasks/`, and without
  `:mix` in the PLT, dialyzer couldn't resolve `Mix.Task`'s callbacks or
  `Mix.shell/0`/`Mix.Task.run/1`, failing the release gate.
- `mix credo --strict` — a test call site spelled out the task's fully
  qualified module name instead of using the alias already in scope,
  tripping Credo's nested-module-aliasing check and (like the dialyzer issue
  above) failing the release gate.

### Notes

- Integration tests (the CRM DB round-trips, including all of
  `party_roles_test.exs` and the supplier-import task's DB-backed cases)
  could not run in this release's build environment (no Postgres available);
  per this repo's documented stance they auto-exclude and only the pure-logic
  unit tests ran. They're expected to run in CI / against a real core
  checkout before this reaches production installs.
- Review docs: `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/{10-crm-party-roles,
  11-schema-prefix,12-import-suppliers-backfill}/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-28

Post-merge review fixes for the interaction-tracker buildout (PR #8) —
correctness, authorization, and performance hardening. No changes to the stable
public surface (`RoleSettings`, `UserRoleView`, `ColumnConfig`).

### Fixed

- `version/0` now reports the package version (it was stale at `0.1.0`); a test
  keeps it in sync with `mix.exs`.
- Company rosters and the company interactions rollup no longer include
  soft-deleted contacts — `Companies.list_memberships/1` excludes trashed members.
- Avatar selection is authorization-scoped: `Attachments.set_avatar/3` only
  accepts an image that belongs to the record's own `Images` folder, so a forged
  event can't point a record's avatar at an arbitrary file.
- Contact/company search escapes the `% _ \` LIKE metacharacters and strips null
  bytes — a literal `%` no longer matches everything, and a null byte can't crash
  Postgres.
- `Contacts.get_by_user_uuid/1` and both `list_by_uuids/1` tolerate malformed
  UUIDs (return `nil`/`[]`) instead of raising an `Ecto.Query.CastError`.
- `Interactions.update_interaction/4` no longer wipes the involved parties when
  none are passed (the default is now "keep"), and preserves each party's frozen
  profile snapshot across an edit instead of re-deriving it from current data.

### Changed

- Composer file uploads are restricted to a curated type allowlist (no inline
  `html`/`svg`/`xml`) with an explicit 25 MiB per-file cap, instead of
  `accept: :any` with the 8 MB default.
- Removed duplicate/needless queries: the contact-form company list and the
  role-view column metadata no longer load in `mount/3` (which runs twice); the
  column modal only queries when open; and the media + company-interactions
  components guard their `update/2` reloads (the contact interactions feed still
  live-refreshes via PubSub).
- The PartyPicker JS hook clears its staging fallback timer on `destroyed()`.

### Internal

- Dialyzer is clean again: fixed two warnings in the PR #8 code and added a
  scoped `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` for the Gettext/Expo opaque-type false positive
  in the generated Gettext backend.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-25

Incremental i18n coverage plus a dependency refresh. No API changes; the
only user-visible behaviour change is the CRM settings tab sort position.

### Added

- Localized the remaining CRM admin page bodies onto the package-owned
  `PhoenixKitCRM.Gettext` backend — `CRMLive` (`CRM`, `Enabled`, `Disabled`),
  `SettingsLive` (page title, headings, helper text, flash messages), and the
  `ColumnManagement` macro flash messages (`Columns updated`,
  `Failed to save columns`). All `Gettext.gettext(PhoenixKitWeb.Gettext, …)`
  long-form calls converted to the short `gettext()` macro. After this release
  there are no references to the host app's `PhoenixKitWeb.Gettext` backend
  left in `lib/`. Full `en`/`ru`/`et` coverage for the new msgids.
- Completed the Estonian catalogue — the 16 previously empty column-customization
  msgids (`Apply`, `Cancel`, `Customize columns`, `Drag to reorder`, `Selected`,
  `Available`, …) are now translated; `et/default.po` is 28/28.

### Changed

- CRM admin sidebar tab `priority` `650 → 924`, repositioning the entry within
  the admin settings group.
- Dependencies refreshed — `phoenix_kit` `1.7.106 → 1.7.120`, `ecto`/`ecto_sql`
  `3.13 → 3.14`, plus patch/minor bumps across `bandit`, `finch`, `plug`,
  `postgrex`, `req`, `swoosh`, `tesla`, `igniter`, and others.
- Tightened the `precommit` alias to `compile --force --warnings-as-errors`,
  `deps.unlock --check-unused`, and `quality.ci`.

### Documentation

- `PhoenixKitCRM.Web.ColumnManagement` moduledoc now lists the host requirement
  to `use Gettext, backend: PhoenixKitCRM.Gettext` (the injected flash messages
  call the bare `gettext/1` macro, kept as a macro so `mix gettext.extract`
  sees the strings).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Per-module Gettext backend (`PhoenixKitCRM.Gettext`) with `en`/`ru`/`et` catalogues for all admin sidebar tab labels (`CRM`, `Overview`, `Organizations`) and UI strings in `ColumnModal` and `CellFormat`. Requires `phoenix_kit` release that ships the `gettext_backend` Tab API ([BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit#522](https://github.com/BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit/pull/522)); on older releases tabs render raw English (graceful degradation).
- All `use Gettext, backend: PhoenixKitWeb.Gettext` references in `PhoenixKitCRM` replaced with the module-owned `PhoenixKitCRM.Gettext` backend — the package no longer depends on the host app's Gettext module.
- Column header translations for the role and Organizations table views — `Email`, `Username`, `Full Name`, `Status`, `Registered`, `Last Confirmed`, `Location`, `Organization`, `Contact`. These labels live in `ColumnConfig` module attributes and are translated at runtime via `Gettext.gettext/2`; msgids are maintained manually in `priv/gettext/default.pot` (alongside the Tab labels) since `mix gettext.extract` only sees `gettext()` macro call sites. Full `en`/`ru`/`et` coverage.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-05

Bug fixes and performance hardening from the PR #4 retrospective review:
LiveView lifecycle correctness on the CRM landing page, an N+1 query
collapse, and a per-cell render hot-path optimization. No breaking
changes — patch release.

### Fixed

- **CRMLive lifecycle.** Role-stat loading moved out of `mount/3`
  (which fires twice per connect — HTTP + WebSocket) into
  `handle_params/3` gated on `connected?/1`. Eliminates duplicate
  queries on every CRM landing-page render.
- **N+1 across enabled roles.** New
  `PhoenixKitCRM.RoleSettings.list_enabled_with_user_counts/0` issues
  a single GROUP BY with a left join over `RoleAssignment`, replacing
  one `Roles.count_users_with_role/1` round-trip per role. Roles with
  zero users still surface (count = 0) thanks to the left join.
- **Per-cell `available_columns/1` recomputation.** Custom-cell render
  no longer rebuilds the full `[{id, meta}]` list per cell. Views
  compute `ColumnConfig.column_metadata_map/1` once per render and
  pass the resolved map through `render_cell/3`, `card_field/3`,
  `column_label/2`, and `CellFormat.render_custom_cell/3`.
  `ColumnModal` does the same lookup once at the top of the function
  component.
- **Unguarded `field["key"]` in custom-field columns.** Malformed
  custom field definitions (no `"key"`) no longer crash the page with
  `ArgumentError: argument for <> is not a binary` — they're filtered
  upstream of the `Enum.map`.
- **Gettext call-style consistency in `CRMLive`.** Switched long-form
  `Gettext.gettext/dngettext(PhoenixKitWeb.Gettext, …)` to the short
  `gettext/ngettext` already in scope via
  `use PhoenixKitWeb, :live_view`, matching `RoleView` /
  `OrganizationsView`.

### Added

- `PhoenixKitCRM.ColumnConfig.column_metadata_map/1` — flat
  `%{column_id => meta}` map for callers that need lookup-by-id without
  rebuilding the available-columns list per call.
- `PhoenixKitCRM.RoleSettings.list_enabled_with_user_counts/0` — single
  GROUP BY query for the CRM overview.

### Changed

- `PhoenixKitCRM.Web.CellFormat.render_custom_cell/3` second arg is
  now a `column_meta` map (not a scope). Internal callers within CRM
  are updated; `CellFormat` was introduced in 0.2.0's PR #4 follow-ups
  and has not been released until now, so no upgraders are affected.
- Dependencies refreshed via `mix deps.update --all`: `bandit`, `ecto`,
  `jason`, `leaf`, `phoenix`, `phoenix_kit`, `phoenix_live_view`,
  `postgrex`. Patch / minor only — no constraint changes in `mix.exs`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-04

Companies → Organizations pivot, i18n foundation, LiveView lifecycle
correctness, and a runtime-crash hotfix. The `Companies` placeholder is
replaced with a real `Organizations` subtab that lists users whose
`account_type = "organization"`. All user-facing strings are routed
through `gettext`. Six public-API renames (scope atom, setting key,
module, path, tab id, `Paths` helper) make this a breaking release.

### Breaking

- **Scope rename** — `:companies` → `:organizations` everywhere
  (`PhoenixKitCRM.UserRoleView.scope/0`, `ColumnConfig` keys,
  `UserRoleViewConfig` rows). `scope_from_string/1` keeps a fallback
  that decodes the legacy `"companies"` string to `:organizations`
  with a `Logger.warning` so existing DB rows don't crash on read —
  host apps should plan a one-shot data migration to rewrite stored
  scope strings.
- **Setting key rename** — `crm_companies_enabled` →
  `enable_organization_accounts`. The Companies-feature toggle on the
  CRM settings page is removed; visibility of the Organizations
  subtab is gated on the PhoenixKit-wide
  `enable_organization_accounts` setting instead.
- **Module rename** — `PhoenixKitCRM.Web.CompaniesView` →
  `PhoenixKitCRM.Web.OrganizationsView`. Host apps with custom
  `live_view:` overrides need to update.
- **Route rename** — `/admin/crm/companies` →
  `/admin/crm/organizations`. Bookmarks and external links break.
- **Tab id rename** — `:admin_crm_companies` →
  `:admin_crm_organizations` in `PhoenixKitCRM.admin_tabs/0`.
- **Path helper rename** — `PhoenixKitCRM.Paths.companies/0` →
  `PhoenixKitCRM.Paths.organizations/0`.

### Added

- **`Organizations` subtab** — real LiveView (replaces the legal-entity
  placeholder) listing users typed as organizations via
  `PhoenixKit.Users.Auth.list_organizations/0`. Per-user column config,
  card/table view toggle, navigation to the PhoenixKit core user view
  on row click.
- **`PhoenixKitCRM.Paths.user_view/1`** — centralized helper for
  navigating to PhoenixKit core's user-view page from CRM tables.
  Empty-string guard raises `ArgumentError`.
- **i18n foundation** — `use Gettext, backend: PhoenixKitWeb.Gettext`
  wired into module-level code. All flashes, page titles, admin tab
  labels, modal UI strings, table headers, empty states, and column
  labels go through `gettext/1`. `ngettext` for the user-count plural.
  Russian column labels in the legacy Companies schema converted to
  English msgids; `ColumnConfig.translate_labels/1` applies `gettext`
  once at the access point so all consumers see translated labels. No
  `priv/gettext/` shipped — translations remain the host app's
  responsibility (matches sibling-module convention).
- **Whole-row click navigation** — table rows in `RoleView` and
  `OrganizationsView` are clickable and navigate to the user-view page
  via `phx-click="navigate_to_user"`.
- **Integration tests (+25)** — `role_settings_integration_test.exs`
  and `user_role_view_integration_test.exs` exercise real DB
  round-trips for upsert, scope isolation, and cross-scope rejection.
  Tagged `:integration` for opt-in.
- **GitHub Actions CI workflow** — first CI workflow in the
  `phoenix_kit_*` family. Caches `deps/`, `_build/`, `priv/plts/` on
  `mix.lock`. Runs `compile --warnings-as-errors`, `quality.ci`
  (format check + credo --strict + dialyzer), and `mix test`.

### Changed

- **LiveView lifecycle (`mount/3` + `handle_params/3` split)** —
  `RoleView` and `OrganizationsView` keep gates in `mount/3` and move
  data loading into `handle_params/3` under `if connected?(socket)`.
  At most one DB query per connected mount (eliminates the duplicate
  query from the static-render pass).
- **`RoleSettings.list_eligible_roles/0`** — filter switched from
  fragile name-match (`role.name in ["Owner", "Admin"]`) to the
  boolean `role.is_system_role`.
- **`ColumnConfig.available_columns/1`** — labels are now translated
  via `gettext` at the access point, so modal/header/card consumers
  all see the translated string.
- **Admin tab paths standardized to absolute form** — every CRM
  module tab path is now absolute (`/admin/crm/...`). Hotfixes a
  runtime crash where `Tab` registrations via
  `Registry.register/2` (used for role subtabs) bypassed
  `Tab.resolve_path/2` and surfaced `RuntimeError: Url path must
  start with "/"` from `Routes.path/2`.
- **HEEx `:if` migration** — `<%= if %>` blocks in `ColumnModal`
  replaced with `:if={...}` attributes (better diffing, statically
  analyzable).
- **Status badges** — raw HTML `<span class="badge ...">` replaced
  with the `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.StatusBadge` component
  (consistent styling, theme-aware).
- **`Paths.role/1`** — empty-string input now raises
  `ArgumentError` instead of producing a malformed URL.

### Fixed

- `mount/3` no longer issues database queries (was called twice per
  initial load: HTTP + WebSocket).
- Sidebar render no longer crashes when role subtabs are registered
  via `Registry.register/2` with relative paths.
- `Paths.user_view/1` line wrapped to satisfy
  `mix format --check-formatted` (post-merge cleanup).

### Notes

- The CHANGELOG 0.1.0 entry forecast that *"the Companies legal-entity
  schema lands in 0.2.x."* The actual 0.2.0 release pivots away from
  legal-entity modeling and toward listing already-typed organization
  user accounts. The legal-entity schema remains future work,
  un-scheduled.
- Per-role uuid-aware columns are still scaffolded (the
  `available_columns/1` clause pattern-matches the role uuid away);
  picking up uuid-keyed customization is out of scope here.
- Five non-blocking review observations are recorded in
  `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/2-cleanup-i18n-hotfix/POST_MERGE_FEEDBACK.md`
  for follow-up PRs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-30

First public release of the CRM module for PhoenixKit. Implements the
`PhoenixKit.Module` behaviour for auto-discovery; ships an admin
sidebar tab with Overview, optional Companies subtab, per-role user
listings, and a settings page. Most of the moving pieces are
backbone — the Companies legal-entity schema is a deliberate
placeholder, ready to land in 0.2.x.

### Added

- **Module behaviour & auto-discovery** — `PhoenixKitCRM` implements
  `PhoenixKit.Module`: `module_key/0`, `module_name/0`, `enabled?/0`,
  `enable_system/0`, `disable_system/0`, `version/0`,
  `permission_metadata/0`, `admin_tabs/0`, `settings_tabs/0`,
  `route_module/0`, `css_sources/0`, `children/0`. Discovered at
  startup via the `@phoenix_kit_module` beam attribute — the host app
  needs no router edits.
- **Admin pages** — Overview LiveView at `/admin/crm`, Companies
  subtab at `/admin/crm/companies` (gated by `crm_companies_enabled`),
  per-role user listings at `/admin/crm/role/:role_uuid`, and the
  settings page at `/admin/settings/crm`. All use
  `use PhoenixKitWeb, :live_view` so they render inside the admin
  layout with the standard core components (`<.icon>`, `<.button>`,
  `TableDefault`, …).
- **Role opt-in flow** — `PhoenixKitCRM.RoleSettings` context
  (`list_enabled/0`, `list_eligible_roles/0`, `set_enabled/2`,
  `enabled?/1`) backed by `phoenix_kit_crm_role_settings`
  (`role_uuid` PK, FK to `phoenix_kit_user_roles`). System roles
  (Owner, Admin) are excluded from the eligible set; the rest can be
  toggled per role from the CRM settings page.
- **Per-user, per-scope view configuration** —
  `PhoenixKitCRM.UserRoleView` context backed by
  `phoenix_kit_crm_user_role_view` (`(user_uuid, scope)` unique;
  JSONB `view_config`; UUIDv7 PK). Scope is
  `:companies | {:role, role_uuid}`. `PhoenixKitCRM.ColumnConfig`
  declares available + default columns per scope and validates input.
- **Column-management mixin** —
  `use PhoenixKitCRM.Web.ColumnManagement` injects the seven event
  handlers (`show_column_modal`, `hide_column_modal`, `add_column`,
  `remove_column`, `reorder_selected_columns`,
  `update_table_columns`, `reset_to_defaults`) shared between
  `RoleView` and `CompaniesView`. The reusable
  `PhoenixKitCRM.Web.ColumnModal` function component drives drag-to-
  reorder selected columns + click-to-add available columns; UX
  matches the `PhoenixKit.Users` table column picker.
- **Companies subtab placeholder** — `CompaniesView` renders the
  table/card view with column picker and a "schema in development"
  banner. The legal-entity schema lands in a future release.
- **Runtime sidebar bootstrap** —
  `PhoenixKitCRM.SidebarBootstrap` (one-shot `Task` via
  `children/0`, `restart: :temporary`) registers per-role tabs into
  `PhoenixKit.Dashboard.Registry` under the `:phoenix_kit_crm_roles`
  namespace. Re-run from `PhoenixKitCRM.refresh_sidebar/0` after each
  `RoleSettings.set_enabled/2` call. No watcher GenServer.
- **Route module** — `PhoenixKitCRM.Routes` declares the
  parameterized `live "/admin/crm/role/:role_uuid"` route that
  resolves the runtime-registered role tabs. Defines
  `admin_routes/0` and `admin_locale_routes/0` with unique `:as`
  aliases; spliced into `phoenix_kit`'s `live_session
  :phoenix_kit_admin`.
- **`PhoenixKitCRM.Paths`** — centralized URL helpers (`index/0`,
  `companies/0`, `role/1`, `settings/0`) routed through
  `PhoenixKit.Utils.Routes.path/1` for prefix/locale handling.
- **Settings keys** — `crm_enabled` (module on/off, also reflected
  on the admin Modules page), `crm_companies_enabled` (Companies
  subtab visibility).
- **Test infrastructure** — `PhoenixKitCRM.Test.Repo`,
  `PhoenixKitCRM.DataCase` (auto-tags `:integration`, sandbox
  setup), `test_helper.exs` (db-availability check via `psql -lqt`,
  `uuid_generate_v7()` SQL function setup, ExUnit start). Integration
  tests are auto-excluded when the test DB is absent.
- **Tests** — 33 in total: behaviour and tab-shape tests
  (`phoenix_kit_crm_test.exs`), pure-function tests for
  `ColumnConfig` (`available_columns`, `default_columns`,
  `validate_columns`, `get_column_metadata`, cross-scope rejection)
  and `UserRoleView` (`scope_to_string`, `scope_from_string`
  including the malformed-input fallback path, the round-trip
  property, `default_config`).
- **`mix test.setup` / `mix test.reset`** aliases and `cli/0`
  `preferred_envs` so the alias auto-runs in `:test`. `:lazy_html`
  test-only dep for `Phoenix.LiveViewTest`.
- **Documentation** — `README.md` covers features, install, routes,
  database, settings keys, and dev workflow. `AGENTS.md` is the
  AI-agents guide modeled on `phoenix_kit_hello_world` and
  `phoenix_kit_staff` — covers the actual scaffold, runtime sidebar
  bootstrap pattern + known limitation, per-user column config,
  conventions, route-module + tab hybrid, test infrastructure, and
  versioning. PR review template + first review at
  `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/1-add-crm-module/`.

### Notes

- Migrations for `phoenix_kit_crm_role_settings` and
  `phoenix_kit_crm_user_role_view` live in `phoenix_kit` core (V105),
  not in this repo. The parent app applies them via
  `mix phoenix_kit.install` / `mix phoenix_kit.update`.
- `enabled?/0` rescues errors and returns `false` so the module
  degrades gracefully when the DB isn't available (boot race,
  migration in progress).
- `refresh_sidebar/0` logs `Logger.warning` on Registry errors instead
  of silently rescuing — Registry API drift surfaces in logs rather
